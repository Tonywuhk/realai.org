# Empowerment

Empowerment is a form of [intrinsic motivation](http://realai.org/intrinsic-motivation). Informally, it measures an agent's ability to affect its environment. It was formally defined in [Salge et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1863) as the maximum of [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) between the agent's action and its future perceptions. It is related to causal entropic force ([Wissner-Gross & Freer, 2013](http://math.mit.edu/~freer/papers/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf)), a theory of intelligence grounded in physics.

[Mohamed & Rezende (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08731) proposed a variational method for scalable optimization of empowerment.
