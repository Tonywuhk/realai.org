# General Reinforcement Learning

Unlike the more popular [standard model-free setup](model-free.md), *general reinforement learning* makes no Markov or ergodicity assumptions. At the expense of more cumbersome notations, it can accomodate a wider variety of agents and environments. Using JavaScript, [Aslanides (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07615) demonstrates how various types of agents behave in a very simple Gridworld environment. The types of agents implemented include AIXI, knowledge-seeking, minimum description length, wireheading, dogmatic prior, and others.
