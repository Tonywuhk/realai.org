# Auxiliary tasks

[Jaderberg & Mnih & Czarnecki et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05397) introduced the **UNREAL** agent that optimizes the combined loss function of reinforcement learning and auxiliary control and reward tasks. The agent significantly outperformed the previous state-of-the-art on Atari. [Shelhamer et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07307) showed that self-supervised pre-training on auxiliary losses also improves reinforcment learning. [Dilokthanakul et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06769) proposed two auxiliary tasks, pixel control and feature control. Their hierarchical model has a metal controller sending tasks and rewards to a subcontroller. In pixel control, the subcontroller is rewarded for changing the pixel values of a particular patch in the input image. In feature control, the subcontroller is rewarded for changing the mean activation value of a particular feature map in a convolutional neural network that encodes the input.
