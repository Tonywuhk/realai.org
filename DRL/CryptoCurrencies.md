# CryptoCurrencies

The CryptoCurrency market can be seen as an environment for [DRL](README.md) agents:

## Background

In an August 2016 report titled [Blockchain - The Trust Disrupter](http://www.the-blockchain.com/docs/Credit-Suisse-Blockchain-Trust-Disrupter.pdf), Credit Suisse listed 13 blocks to Bitcoin dominance, including irrecoverability of private keys and irreversibility of transactions. Bitcoin is [vulnerable to Internet routing attacks](https://btc-hijack.ethz.ch/) such as BGP hijacks.

## Initial Coin Offerings

A [curated list](https://www.smithandcrown.com/icos/) of initial coin offerings (ICOs) is maintained by [Smith+Crown](https://www.smithandcrown.com/).

[Basic Attention Token](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) ([BAT](https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/basic-attention-token/)) is an Ethereum-based token developed to work with the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/). On 31 May 2017, it raised about [$35 million in 30 seconds](http://www.coindesk.com/35-million-30-seconds-token-sale-internet-browser-brave-sells/). The project was [launched in late March](http://www.coindesk.com/web-browser-brave-to-launch-ico-for-ethereum-ad-token/). By 3 June 2017, BAT had a market cap of more than $160 million, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/basic-attention-token/).

[Bancor](https://www.bancor.network/) Network Token ([BNT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bancor/)) is a smart token initially deployed on the Ethereum network.

[EOS](https://eos.io/) ([EOS](https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/eos/)) was proposed in May 2017 as an [enterprise scale operating system](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ethereum-killer-here-eos-enterprise-scale-operating-sanjay-mehta) for blockchain applications. By 1 July 2017, it [raised $185 million in 5 days](https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/01/185-million-in-5-days-block-one-sets-new-ico-record-with-its-eos-token/), setting a new ICO record.

[Tezos](https://www.tezos.com/) is a blockchain that [governs itself](https://www.tezos.com/governance) with rules for stakeholders to approve of protocal upgrades that are then automatically deployed on the network. By 5 July 2017, it [raised over $200 million in 4 days](http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/tezos-ico-cryptocurrency-startup/), setting a new ICO record. According to [ZeroHedge](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-05/ex-goldman-hft-trader-makes-blockchain-history-raising-200-million-tezos-ico-4-days), Tezos was established by a husband and wife team.

[TrueBit](https://truebit.io/) claims to be a scalable verification solution for blockchains. According to its [whitepaper](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~teutsch/papers/truebit.pdf), it has a dispute resolution layer that takes the form of a verification game.

## Exchanges

* 2017 August 3. [Bitcoin Exchange Had Too Many Bitcoins](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-02/bitcoin-exchange-had-too-many-bitcoins). *Bloomberg View*.

There are [dozens of](https://www.cryptocoincharts.info/markets/info) of cryptocurrency exchanges. On 7-8 May 2017, San Francisco-based [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) and Delaware-based [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/) experienced DDoS attacks during which a large Ethereum sell order caused many leveraged positions to be liquidated. The Cointelegraph [reported on 15 May 2017](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-exchanges-kraken-poloniex-to-be-scrutinized-for-possible-insider-trading-manipulation) that these exchanges were being scrutinized by a law firm.

Prices of the same coin can vary widely on different exchanges. The discrepancy can be easily seen on [an OKCoin comparison page](https://www.okcoin.com/marketList.html) for BTC and LTC. There are good reasons for this apparent lack of arbitrage. For example, between April and May 2017, Crypto/USD pairs [went from premium to discount](https://medium.com/@Austerity_Sucks/why-bitfinex-went-from-a-premium-in-its-crypto-usd-pairs-to-now-a-significant-discount-e7be193d7cb0) on Bitfinex, an exchange that was [hacked in August 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack).

## Decentralized Computation

The [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) network faces the problem of scalability as its protocol requires all miners to verify computations, known as the Verifier's Dilemma ([Luu et al., 2015](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2813659)). Solutions have been proposed include Golem ([Whitepaper](https://golem.network/doc/Golemwhitepaper.pdf)) and [Truebit](https://truebit.io/) ([Whitepaper](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~teutsch/papers/truebit.pdf)). The latter was included as part of a proposed [dApp developer stack](https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/the-dapp-developer-stack-the-blockchain-industry-barometer-8d55ec1c7d4).

Private blockchain systems are designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. [BLOCKBENCH](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04057) is an evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains.

Accumulated wisdoms and experiences from the governance of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can potentially be [applied](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/why-cryptoeconomics-and-x-risk-researchers-should-listen-to-each-other-more-a2db72b3e86b) to help improve AI safety.

## Steem

[Steem](https://steem.io/) is a blockchain-based [social media platform](https://steemit.com/) where [anyone](https://steemd.com/) can earn [rewards](https://steemwhales.com/). According to its [white paper](https://steem.io/SteemWhitePaper.pdf), it has a *subjective* Proof of Work system that allows a community to be built around any concept that has a sufficiently defined purpose.

According to a July 2016 post by [dan](https://steemit.com/@dan), Steemit's [evil plan](https://steemit.com/steem/@dan/steemit-s-evil-plan-for-cryptocurrency-world-domination) is bootstrapping a digital currency.

Similar to Steem, there are [Golos](https://golos.io/) in Russian and [Yoyow](https://yoyow.org/) in Chinese.
