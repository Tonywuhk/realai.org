## Overview

[DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) Technologies Limited is a private limited company incorporated on September 23, 2010. Until November 15, 2010, its name was "FRIARS 2022 LIMITED". Google acquired DeepMind for more than $500M, as [reported by TechCrunch on January 26, 2014](https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/26/google-deepmind/), or £400m as [understood by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind). In a [Wired UK report on June 22, 2015](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind), DeepMind's cofounder and chief executive Demis Hassabis reflected on why he sold the company, "I realised that there's maybe not enough time in one lifetime to both build a Google-sized company and solve AI. Would I be happier looking back on building a multi-billion business or helping solve intelligence? It was an easy choice. And there was something Larry said to me: 'I spent 15 years building Google -- why don't you just come and take advantage of the opportunity we've built here?' I didn't have a good answer to that."

On 23 October 2014, Google [announced on its Europe blog](https://europe.googleblog.com/2014/10/teaming-up-with-oxford-university-on.html) that Oxford's AI research teams Dark Blue Labs and Vision Factory would join DeepMind. This news was reported by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/23/googles-deepmind-acqui-hires-two-ai-teams-in-the-uk-partners-with-oxford/) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/23/google-uk-artificial-intelligence-startups-machine-learning-dark-blue-labs-vision-factory).

DeepMind's [official records](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07386350) are available from [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house).

DeepMind has two main lines of business: Research and Applied. Its organized efforts in research has yielded a long list of [publications](http://realai.org/labs/deepmind/publications/).

## Organized Research

According to a [Financial Times report on March 17, 2017](https://www.ft.com/content/cada14c4-d366-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0), DeepMind’s researchers are organised into four main groups including “Neuroscience” and “Frontiers”, each consisting of smaller teams with deeper specialties. "Strike teams" can be formed temporarily to achieve a particular goal. Resources are allocated to projects by team leaders including Hassabis and head of research Shane Legg, who said "It’s sort of a bubbling cauldron of ideas, and exploration, and testing things out, and finding out what seems to be working and why — or why not."

## Applications

DeepMind Applied is led by Mustafa Suleyman, and works in two sectors: [DeepMind Health](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/) and [DeepMind for Google](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-for-google/).

In March 2017, a machine learning expert [believed](http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/google-will-disrupt-funds-management-says-machine-learning-expert-20170329-gv93jc) that a new powerful **fund management** machine would likely emerge from DeepMind.
