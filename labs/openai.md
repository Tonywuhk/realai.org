# OpenAI

OpenAI is a non-profit AI research company founded on [December 11, 2015](https://blog.openai.com/introducing-openai/) for which prominent tech executives have [pledged $1bn](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35082344).

It is stated in OpenAI's [mission](https://openai.com/about/#mission) that "We will not keep information private for private benefit, but in the long term, we expect to create formal processes for keeping technologies private when there are safety concerns". In its [$30 million grant](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/openai-general-support) to support OpenAI, the Open Philanthropy Project noted and [archived](http://files.openphilanthropy.org/files/Grants/OpenAI/OpenAI_Mission.pdf) this mission.

OpenAI's [technical goals](https://blog.openai.com/openai-technical-goals/) include building a measure of research progress, and agents that can perform housework, understand natural language, and solve a wide variety of games.

A group of sponsors committed $1 billion at OpenAI's formation, although only a tiny fraction was expected to be spent in the next a few years.
