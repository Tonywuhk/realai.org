# Google Brain

[Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/) is a research team that aims to make machines intelligent and improve people’s lives. Most of the team is based in Mountain View, but there are smaller groups of team members in Cambridge (Massachusetts), London, Montreal, New York, San Francisco, Toronto and Zurich.

According to [web page dated 10 Aug 2012](http://www.artificialbrains.com/google), the Google cofounders have long been interested in AI and said their aim is for Google Search to become AI-complete. An internal company memo in 2006 said that Google wants to have the world's top AI research laboratory.

In May 2011, Business Insider [reported](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-state-of-google-2011-5) that Google has an unannounced division called "Google X". Google Brain [graduated in 2012](https://x.company/graduated/) from [X](https://x.company/), a moonshot factory whose mission is to invent and launch “moonshot” technologies that could someday make the world a radically better place.

On 12 March 2013, Google acquired DNNresearch, a startup founded by University of Toronto's professor Geoffrey Hinton and two of his grad students ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/12/google-scoops-up-neural-networks-startup-dnnresearch-to-boost-its-voice-and-image-search-tech/), [VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/12/google-dnnresearch/)). According to a [leiphone.com report](https://www.leiphone.com/news/201704/A9RuQzPwYKKLkIJT.html), Google paid $50 million.

## Brain Residency

The [Google Brain Residency Program](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/residency/) was launched in October 2015. It is a 12-month role based in Mountain View, California. The first group of residents arrived in June 2016.

## Research

In an August 2017 [lecture](https://blog.ycombinator.com/jeff-deans-lecture-for-yc-ai/), Google Brain leader Jeff Dean repeatedly mentioned the prospect of a massively multi-task model that could potentially solve thousands of tasks, each task perhaps only activating a tiny portion of a trillion parameters in the model. Such a multi-task model might also get a neural net to reason more like humans do.
