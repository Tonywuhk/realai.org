## Governance

### Registrations

We file [annual returns](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/compliance/PrivateCompany.htm) with the [Companies Registry](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/home/index.htm), and pay [Business Registration Fee and Levy](http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/pdf/brfee_table.pdf) to the [Inland Revenue Department](http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/welcome.htm).

### Annual General Meeting

In general, a Hong Kong company must hold an annual general meeting (AGM) every year, but as a single member company, Real AI is [not required](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/companies_ordinance/faq_meet-res-co-record.htm#03) to do so.

### Company Directors

The Companies Registry advises all directors to read this [Guide](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/publications/docs/director_guide-e.pdf) on directors' duties.

### Company Secretary

A private Hong Kong company [must have](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/faq/faq01.htm#022) a company secretary. Our company secretary is provided by [OneStart](http://www.onestartoffices.com/).

We plan to include in our Articles of Association clauses that state precisely and clearly our objectives, and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.
