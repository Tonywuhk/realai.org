# Outreach

Aimed at educating the public about artificial intelligence, Real AI prepared the following materials:

* *Future of AI* is a presentation for the general audience about the impacts, timing and the current state of artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the near-term plausibility of AGI. Its content is based on the non-technical information presented on this site.
* *Near-Term AGI* is a more technical presentation assuming familiarity with AGI. It focuses on recent AGI developments and uses some materials adapted from the Future of AI presentation.
* *AI Identity* is a short presentation discussing how philosophical theories of identity apply to intelligent systems.
* *Basic TensorFlow* is a short [course](http://realai.org/course/tensorflow/) for everyday computer users to quickly gain hands-on coding experience in an advanced deep learning software library.
