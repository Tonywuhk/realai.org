## Chatbot

Non-AGI chatbots are already useful in a wide range of scenarios. Semantic Machines presents some [use cases](http://www.semanticmachines.com/case/) demonstrating how AI-powered conversational interfaces unlock simple yet powerful interactions. In October 2017, Andrew Ng [announced](https://medium.com/@andrewng/woebot-ai-for-mental-health-d0e8632b82ba) that he became chairman of [Woebot](http://woebot.io/), a company in its mission to build a chatbot that will help the millions of people who struggle with their mental health.

## APIs

## Financial Markets Applications

According to a [Bloomberg Technology report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-28/fund-manager-who-traded-for-cohen-trains-algos-to-copy-his-brain) in June 2017, a hedge fund is testing models that mimic trades of its portfolio managers. The work of execution traders are also being automated. In September 2017, Bloomberg Markets [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-09-27/the-massive-hedge-fund-betting-on-ai) that AI generated profits for Man Group, but its engineers couldn't explain why the AI was executing the trades it was making.

In July 2017, Financial Times [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/16b8ffb6-7161-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c) that JPMorgan uses deep reinforcement learning to develop a trade execution system internally known as LOXM, which has been in use in the bank's European equities algorithms business since the first quarter. JPMorgan believes it is the first on Wall Street to use AI with trade execution and said it would take rivals 18 to 24 months and an investment of multiple millions to come up with similar technology.

## Healthcare

* 2017 January 25. [Deep learning algorithm does as well as dermatologists in identifying skin cancer](http://news.stanford.edu/press-releases/2017/01/25/artificial-inteltify-skin-cancer/). *Stanford News*.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning

After the release of AlphaGo Zero, Quartz [reported](https://qz.com/1105509/deepminds-new-alphago-zero-artificial-intelligence-is-ready-for-more-than-board-games/) that according to Demis Hassabis, DRL can be applied to "drug discovery, proteins, quantum chemistry, material design." A Financial Times [report](https://www.ft.com/content/39786fe4-b3e4-11e7-aa26-bb002965bce8) mentioned "climate modelling."
