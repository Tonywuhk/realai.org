## Financial Markets Applications

According to a [Bloomberg Technology report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-28/fund-manager-who-traded-for-cohen-trains-algos-to-copy-his-brain) in June 2017, a hedge fund is testing models that mimic trades of its portfolio managers. The work of execution traders are also being automated. In September 2017, Bloomberg Markets [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-09-27/the-massive-hedge-fund-betting-on-ai) that AI generated profits for Man Group, but its engineers couldn't explain why the AI was executing the trades it was making.
