# Cognitive Science

Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. Cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology.

## AGI Projects

### OpenCog

[OpenCog](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/The_Open_Cognition_Project) is an open-source development effort for the CogPrime approach to AGI, which is based on the idea that human level intelligence can emerge from integrating multiple learning systems and memory components in an appropriate architecture and environment. CogPrime is a comprehensive architecture that contains more than two dozens of cognitive processes such as procedure repository, associative episodic memory, backup store, spacetime server, world simulation, etc. All these cognitive processes operate by observing and modifying certain Atoms in the Atomspace, which is also a cognitive process that models high-level mind architecture and working memory. A conceptual depiction of CogPrime is provided in Fig. 2.1 of [Goertzel et al. (2014)](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789462390263), who point out that the human brain appears to be an integration of algorithms and structures honed by evolution to inter-adapt, and believe that the main missing ingredient in AI is to *design* this cognitive synergy. The emphasis here is to note that in the CogPrime approach, the synergy is supposed to be designed instead of learned.

The OpenCog AGI engine is a component underlying the "Sophia" Hanson Robotics robot that is center to the "Loving AI" project, which is described in more details in [Goertzel et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07791), a somewhat unconventional arXiv preprint that contains a section of less than 1 page to discuss the "Underlying AI Technologies," and a subsection of more than 4 pages that records "Comments by the Project Leaders."

### NARS

[NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System)](https://sites.google.com/site/narswang/home) is a general-purpose reasoning system, coming from [Pei Wang](https://cis.temple.edu/~pwang/PeiWangCV.html)'s study of AI and cognitive science. It has a publicly shared [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-nars).
