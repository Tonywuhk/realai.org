# Background

Due to the relative ease of becoming a "world-class deep learning practitioner" ([Howard, 2017](http://www.fast.ai/2017/09/08/introducing-pytorch-for-fastai/)), mainstream AI researchers typically lack in-depth understanding of related academic fields such as [neuroscience](http://realai.org/background/neuroscience/), [cognitive science](http://realai.org/background/cognitive-science/), physics as [computation](http://realai.org/background/computation/), and [philosophy](http://realai.org/background/philosophy/). This problem is exacerbated by the fact that these fields are often large and steeped in their own traditions. In neuroscience, for example, there's something like 50,000 papers a year and it's "quite difficult to be expert" in it ([Vincent, 2017](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/19/15998610/ai-neuroscience-machine-learning-deepmind-demis-hassabis-interview)).
