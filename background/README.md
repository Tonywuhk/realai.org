# Background

Building artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a daunting task. Concretely, the components that eventually contribute to a valid AGI project is "likely only very sparsely populated" ([Hassabis et al., 2017](http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30509-3)) in the vast search space of meaningful computer programs, underscoring the utility of strategic guidance provided by related academic fields such as [neuroscience](http://realai.org/background/neuroscience/), [cognitive science](http://realai.org/background/cognitive-science/), physics as [computation](http://realai.org/background/computation/), and [philosophy](philosophy/README.md). Considerable efforts have been expended in these disciplines to understand the essence of intelligence, and insights obtained from there often can point to promising directions.

Due to the relative ease of becoming a "world-class deep learning practitioner" ([Howard, 2017](http://www.fast.ai/2017/09/08/introducing-pytorch-for-fastai/)), mainstream AI researchers typically lack in-depth understanding of these related academic fields. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that these fields are often large and steeped in their own traditions. In neuroscience, for example, there's something like 50,000 papers a year and it's "quite difficult to be expert" in it ([Vincent, 2017](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/19/15998610/ai-neuroscience-machine-learning-deepmind-demis-hassabis-interview)).
