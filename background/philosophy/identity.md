# Identity

The subject of identity deals with *philosophical* questions like whether two or more intelligent systems are the same. These intelligent systems can be separated by time or appear concurrently while separated by space. When the intelligent systems under consideration are persons, this subject reduces to its special case of [personal identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identity), which contains a wide range of loosely connected questions such as "Who am I?" "What am I?" "When did I begin?" Many of these questions occur to nearly all of us now and again ([Olsen, 2017](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/)).

Identity is one of the most complex problems. [Turchin (2016)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nuc/identity_map/) created a map of over 20 theories of identity, then acknowledges that we don't yet know its nature.

[Extended cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_cognition) is the view that the mind extends beyond the boundary of skin and skull as mental processes can involve external devices such as notebooks and calculators. In this framework, the mind can even extend socially such as in the case of an unusually interdependent couple where one partner relies on the other to recognize people ([Clark & Chalmers, 1998](http://consc.net/papers/extended.html)).
