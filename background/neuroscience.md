# Neuroscience

## Background

Neuroscience can provide a rich source of inspiration for new types of AI algorithms and architectures, as well as help validate existing techniques ([Hassabis, 2012](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386/full/482462a.html)), for example, based on if they mimic a function within the brain. Looking forward, [Summerfield et al. (2017)](https://deepmind.com/blog/ai-and-neuroscience-virtuous-circle/) believe that neuroscience will become "indispensable" for tackling unsolved problems.

The contribution of neuroscience to AI progress is further explained in [Hassabis et al. (2017)](http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30509-3), a review paper published in July 2017, where it is stated that "if one scratches the surface, one can uncover many cases in which recent developments have been inspired and guided by neuroscientific considerations." They then provide four examples: attention, episodic memory, working memory, and continual learning.

We broadly share this belief that neuroscience has been and will continue to be crucial for AI progress, however, since June 2017, our view has been that there isn't much space for *new* neuroscience discoveries to significantly impact the direction and methodologies of current technical development towards AGI. In other words, despite numerous unanswered questions in neuroscience, we have already known enough for the purpose of *building* an AGI system. We maintain this page to monitor the field just in case there is any surprise.

## Spiking Neural Networks

[Zenke & Ganguli (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11146) propose to train spiking neurons by a gradient descent rule that takes the form

$$
\frac{\partial w_{ij}}{\partial t} = r \int^t_{-\infty}ds [\alpha * (\hat{S}_i-S_i)(s)] [ \alpha * ({\sigma}'(U_i(s))(\epsilon * S_j)(s) ],
$$

where \\(r\\) is the learning rate, and the integrand is the product of an error signal and a Hebbian term which combines pre- and postsynaptic activity. They demonstrate that a single LIF neuron can learn to emit a predefined target spike pattern.

## Some Theories of Intelligence

Neuroscience has spurred many attempts at building machine intelligence, such as [Hierarchical Temporal Memory](http://numenta.org/) ([Hawkins et al., 2016](http://numenta.com/biological-and-machine-intelligence/)) and [Feynman Machine](https://hackernoon.com/feynman-machine-a-new-approach-for-cortical-and-machine-intelligence-5855c0e61a70).
