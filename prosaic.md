# Prosaic AI

Deep learning has achieved great successes in areas of artificial intelligence over a [relatively short period](http://realai.org/progress/). Remarkably, its main principles were established in the 1950's and 60's. Numerous technical innovations contribute to these successes, but none amounts to a profound scientific discovery such as a new theory of the mind. Many difficult cognitive tasks are solved using deep learning, surprising AI researchers who expect involvement of more explicit mathematical modeling using tools such as logic ([Darwiche, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04327)).

It seems increasingly plausible that high-level machine intelligence could be built by scaling up current methods in deep learning, without qualitatively new ideas about "how intelligence works" ([Christiano, 2016](https://ai-alignment.com/prosaic-ai-control-b959644d79c2)). Complex intelligent behavior can emerge from generic learning objectives when deep neural network-based models have sufficient learning capacity, and training data contains sufficient richness and diversity. Moreover, similar behavior is difficult to induce by explicit engineering in simple environments as solutions found are often idiosyncratic because they overfit the learning objectives. Under this premise, the improvement of engineering capability will lead to the creation of AGI.

## Progress

### Locomotion Behavior

In [Heess et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02286), agents successfully learn complex locomotion behavior such as running, jumping, crouching and turning. The agents are trained with deliberately simple and generic reward functions, but over a wide range of environmental conditions. They learn faster following a curriculum. The architecture used in these agents is similar to [Heess et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05182), an earlier work on hierarchical motor control published about 9 months before.
