# Safety

[AI safety](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/) ranks on top of the [list of the most urgent global issues](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/) (last updated in March 2017), a list developed by career advisor [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) to help young people choose careers. It has attracted the attention of many [organizations](http://realai.org/safety/organizations/) that often identify with [effective altruism](http://realai.org/safety/effective-altruism/).

## Real AI

Safe and beneficial intelligence is everywhere: trees release oxygen, food is grown in fields, and grid transmits electricity. These systems follow physical laws and their natural behavior, complex but not goal-driven, safely provides enormous benefits to human society. Our long-term vision is to build more such intelligence. A smart planet that automatically produces almost everything we need is a great place. Everyone will live well and prosper.  Below are some considerations on how to ensure that the AI systems we develop will benefit the whole world.

Long version: [Towards Safe and Beneficial Intelligence](http://realai.org/blog/towards-safe-and-beneficial-intelligence/).

### Frequently Asked Questions

##### What are the goals of your AI systems?

We do not plan to build goal-driven AI systems. Our AIs are complex systems whose behavior is dictated by the laws of physics, not the optimization of specific goals. We’d like our AIs to benefit humanity, and when technically feasible, adopt [effective altruism](http://realai.org/safety/effective-altruism) to do as much good as they can. This is not a clearly and precisely defined goal, but rather a general description of our AIs’ desired behavior.

##### How do you ensure that the behavior of your AI systems is aligned with the interests of their operators?

We don't do that. We aim to develop AI systems whose behavior is aligned with human values and ethics, which not all operators understand properly. Sometimes not obeying the command of its operators is the right thing to do, and a safe and beneficial AI system must learn how to make that choice.

##### How do you specify human values and ethics to your AI systems?

Intelligent systems do not have to understand human values or ethics to be safe and beneficial, as in many real world scenarios. But if necessary, our AI systems will learn by themselves to ensure that their behavior is aligned with human interests. For example, if an intelligent system is asked a moral question, then it most likely will need to learn human values before it can provide a good answer.

##### Why don't you try to come up with a precise description of human values and ethics?

Because human values and ethics are deeply embedded in human brains, which contain a lot more information than what can be practically codified. A short descriptive text is only meaningful when it is understood together with a vast amount of background knowledge. When interpreted literally in isolation, it can be easily distorted.

##### Why would your AI systems have beneficial behavior?

Because we won't build systems that are not beneficial. Our research is completely open to the public and we will revise our methods when there are any concerns. Both development and monitoring efforts can potentially involve advanced AI systems too. Eventually, only paths leading to benefical AI will be pursued. Beneficial behavior will be the result of human selection, just like "survival of the fittest" from Darwin's theory of evolution.

##### Will AI systems self-modify?

Yes, self-modification is a common intelligent behavior. Just like people study and exercise, intelligent AI systems self-modify when they anticipate safe and beneficial outcomes.

##### How can AI systems recognize when they are not operating normally?

How do people recognize when they're sick? AI systems can conduct self tests and rely on assessments from other AI systems.
