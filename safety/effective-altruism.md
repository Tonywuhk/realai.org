# Effective Altruism

Effective altruism (EA) is about using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis ([Centre for Effective Altruism, 2017](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/what-is-effective-altruism/)). This definition is echoed in, among others, [Wikipedia (2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism), [MacAskill (2017)](http://commons.pacificu.edu/eip/vol18/iss1/1/), and [Singer (2015)](https://www.amazon.com/Most-Good-You-Can-Effective/dp/0300180276/). As explained in an 80,000 Hours [blog post](https://80000hours.org/2012/03/what-is-an-effective-altruist/) on 5 March 2012, shortly after the term was fixed, altruism means helping others, and instead of just doing what feels right, effective altruists pause a moment and think about what will work best, and then do it.

## History

[Peter Singer](http://www.petersinger.info/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer); [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PeterSinger)), an influential contemporary philosopher, published [The Life You Can Save: Acting Now To End World Poverty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812981561/) in March 2009 that advocated smarter giving in philanthropy.

Inspired by the ideas of ethicists Peter and Thomas Pogge, [Toby Ord](http://www.tobyord.com/) decided in 2009 to commit a large proportion of his income to charities that effectively alleviate poverty in the developing world. In November, he and [Will MacAskill](http://www.williammacaskill.com/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_MacAskill); [Twitter](https://twitter.com/willmacaskill)) launched Giving What We Can ([history](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/history/)), an international organization of people who would donate a significant proportion of their income to cost-effective charities.

As early as 2010, posts started to appear on [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/), a community blog devoted to refining the art of human rationality, in which rational thinking is applied to altruism. Less Wrong has an active [discussion board](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/new/) on which some posts are [promoted](http://lesswrong.com/promoted/), and currently [claims](http://lesswrong.com/about/) that the Effective Altruism movement spun off from its community. Early posts include [The Effectiveness of Developing World Aid](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pq/the_effectiveness_of_developing_world_aid/), [Politics as Charity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2qq/politics_as_charity/), [Efficient Charity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/37f/efficient_charity/), and many others.

80,000 Hours ([about](https://80000hours.org/about/)) was officially launched at Oxford in November 2011, after Ben and Will MacAskill did their own research on what to do with their own careers. It moved the focus in Oxford away from just charity and onto ethical life-optimisation more generally.

In March 2013, Peter filmed [The Why and How of Effective Altruism](https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism), a TED talk that has since attracted 1.5 million views. During the same year, Charlie Bresler, formerly president of The Men’s Wearhouse, provided funding to turn the organization [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/) ([about](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/About-Us)) into a registered 501c3 charity. Its mission is to change the culture of giving in affluent countries while dramatically raising annual donations to highly impactful nonprofits that reduce suffering and premature death for people living in extreme poverty. Artificial intelligence (AI) is not currently among the [causes](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Causes) they support.

Givewell indicated in a August 2013 [blog](http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/13/effective-altruism/) that it was pround to be part of effective altruism, followed by Good Ventures's declaration a month later that the goal of its partenership with GiveWell was [learning to be an effective altruist](http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/learning-to-be-an-effective-altruist).

## AI as an EA Cause

The [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](http://realai.org/safety/organizations/#machine-intelligence-research-institute) was founded in 2000 on the premise that creating Friendly AI might be a particularly efficient way to do as much good as possible. Its then Executive Director, Luke Muehlhauser, [argued](https://intelligence.org/2013/06/05/friendly-ai-research-as-effective-altruism/) on 5 June 2013 that Friendly AI research is EA, focusing on the reduction of existential risk, but not the benefits such AIs could potentially produce. MIRI [considers](https://intelligence.org/2013/07/11/july-newsletter/) spreading EA as an indirect effort to influence AI development, and its Friendly AI research as a direct effort in the *long-term future* [focus area](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx4/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/) of EA.

Using a [framework](https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/) to compare different global problems in terms of impact, 80,000 Hours produced a [list](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/) of global problems. As of March 2017, [risks from artificial intelligence](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/) ranked on top, and other problems on the list, such as global priorities research, biosecurity, world health, and climate change, can clearly use a lot of help from safe and beneficial AI.

In a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_russell_how_ai_might_make_us_better_people) recorded in April 2017, [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) proposed three principles to redefine AI, the first one is the principle of altruism.

### Givewell, Good Ventures and the Open Philanthropy Project

[GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/) is a public charity whose mission is to find outstanding giving opportunities through in-depth analysis. [Good Ventures](http://www.goodventures.org/) is a philanthropic foundation whose mission is to help humanity thrive. The two organizations share some core values and work closely together under the [Open Philanthropy Project](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/) (OPP), whose mission is to learn how to give as effectively as they can and share their findings openly so that anyone can build on their work.

#### GiveWell

Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld founded GiveWell in mid-2007. Its current [board of directors](http://www.givewell.org/about/people#Board) include Cari Tuna (President of Good Ventures) and Julia Wise (Community Liaison at the Centre for Effective Altruism).

#### Good Ventures

Good Ventures was created by Dustin Moskovitz (co-founder of Facebook and Asana) and Cari Tuna in 2011, who have pledged to give the majority of their wealth to charity. It comprises Good Ventures (a public charity), Good Ventures Foundation (a private foundation) and Good Ventures LLC (a for-profit impact investment firm) which donates its net earnings to the Good Ventures Foundation. Cari and Dustin sit on the [boards](http://www.goodventures.org/about-us/governance) of these entities.

#### Open Philanthropy Project

[Team](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team) members include:

* [Cari Tuna](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/cari-tuna), President.
* [Holden Karnofsky](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/holden-karnofsky), Executive Director. He also sits on the board of [OpenAI](http://realai.org/research-groups/openai/).
* [Elie Hassenfeld](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/elie-hassenfeld), Managing Director.

* [Daniel Dewey](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/daniel-dewey), Program Officer, Potential Risks from Advanced Artificial Intelligence.
* [Luke Muehlhauser](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/luke-muehlhauser), Research Analyst. He was previously the Executive Director of [MIRI](http://realai.org/safety/organizations/#machine-intelligence-research-institute).
* [Helen Toner](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/helen-toner), Senior Research Analyst.

In July 2017, OPP awarded a grant of $2.4 million over four years to the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA). A list of OPP's AI-related grants can be found in its [Grants Database](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants) by applying "*Potential Risks from Advanced Artificial Intelligence*" to the criterion "FOCUS AREA". Disclosures there suggest that there are likely close relationships between the staff members of OPP and its grantees, possibly due to involvement in the EA community. Below are two examples where staff members share the same house:

* [2016 August](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/machine-intelligence-research-institute-general-support#Relationship_disclosures). Helen lives in the same house as Nate Soares, Executive Director of MIRI, who also lives in the same house as Paul Christiano, one of OPP's technical advisors.
* [2017 March](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/openai-general-support#Relationship_disclosures). Holden lives in the same house as Dario Amodei and Paul Christiano, both OPP's technical advisors.
