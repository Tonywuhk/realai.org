# Effective Altruism

Effective altruism (EA), as currently (28 April 2017) [understood](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/what-is-effective-altruism/) by the Centre for Effective Altruism, "is about using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis." As explained in an 80,000 Hours [blog post](https://80000hours.org/2012/03/what-is-an-effective-altruist/) on 5 March 2012, shortly after the term was fixed, altruism means helping others, and instead of just doing what feels right, effective altruists pause a moment and think about what will work best, and then do it.

## History

[Peter Singer](http://www.petersinger.info/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer); [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PeterSinger)), an influential contemporary philosopher, published [The Life You Can Save: Acting Now To End World Poverty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812981561/) in March 2009 that advocated smarter giving in philanthropy.

Inspired by the ideas of ethicists Peter and Thomas Pogge, [Toby Ord](http://www.tobyord.com/) decided in 2009 to commit a large proportion of his income to charities that effectively alleviate poverty in the developing world. In November, he and [Will MacAskill](http://www.williammacaskill.com/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_MacAskill); [Twitter](https://twitter.com/willmacaskill)) launched Giving What We Can ([history](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/history/)), an international organization of people who would donate a significant proportion of their income to cost-effective charities.

As early as 2010, posts started to appear on [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/), a community blog devoted to refining the art of human rationality, in which rational thinking is applied to altruism. Less Wrong has an active [discussion board](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/new/) on which some posts are [promoted](http://lesswrong.com/promoted/), and currently [claims](http://lesswrong.com/about/) that the Effective Altruism movement spun off from its community. Early posts include [The Effectiveness of Developing World Aid](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pq/the_effectiveness_of_developing_world_aid/), [Politics as Charity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2qq/politics_as_charity/), [Efficient Charity](http://lesswrong.com/lw/37f/efficient_charity/), and many others.

80,000 Hours ([about](https://80000hours.org/about/)) was officially launched at Oxford in November 2011, after Ben and Will MacAskill did their own research on what to do with their own careers. It moved the focus in Oxford away from just charity and onto ethical life-optimisation more generally.

In March 2013, Peter filmed [The Why and How of Effective Altruism](https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism), a TED talk that has since attracted 1.5 million views. During the same year, Charlie Bresler, formerly president of The Men’s Wearhouse, provided funding to turn the organization [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/) ([about](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/About-Us)) into a registered 501c3 charity. Its mission is to change the culture of giving in affluent countries while dramatically raising annual donations to highly impactful nonprofits that reduce suffering and premature death for people living in extreme poverty. Artificial intelligence is not currently among the [causes](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Causes) they support.

The [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](http://realai.org/safety/research-groups/#machine-intelligence-research-institute) was founded in 2000 on the premise that creating Friendly AI might be a particularly efficient way to do as much good as possible. Its then Executive Director, Luke Muehlhauser, [argued](https://intelligence.org/2013/06/05/friendly-ai-research-as-effective-altruism/) on 5 June 2013 that Friendly AI research is EA, focusing on the reduction of existential risk, but not the benefits such AIs could potentially produce. MIRI [considers](https://intelligence.org/2013/07/11/july-newsletter/) spreading EA as an indirect effort to influence AI development, and its Friendly AI research as a direct effort in the *long-term future* [focus area](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx4/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/) of EA.

Using a [framework](https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/) to compare different global problems in terms of impact, 80,000 Hours produced a [list](https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/) of global problems. As of March 2017, [risks from artificial intelligence](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/) ranked on top, and other problems on the list, such as global priorities research, biosecurity, world health, and climate change, can clearly use a lot of help from safe and beneficial AI.

## Select List of Organizations

Below is a non-exhaustive list of organizations that are related to effetive altruism and not considered [AI safety research groups](http://realai.org/safety/research-groups/).
