# Automated Theorem Proving

From counting to Clay Mathematics Institute's [Millennium Problems](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems), the [mathematics trench](https://i.imgur.com/muXx1kp.jpg) is incredibly deep. Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is about proving math theorems automatically. In June 2016, it was demonstrated for the first time ([Alemi et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04442)) that neural networks are useful in large scale ATP. Two months later, [Whalen (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02644) proposed a complete architecture combining deep learning and tree search for the [Metamath](http://realai.org/metamath/) system. Deep learning was incorporated by [Loos et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06972) into the proof search procedure of the [E Theorem Prover](http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html) in January 2017. In March, [Kaliszyk et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00426) introduced a [HOL Light](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/) dataset to the public.
