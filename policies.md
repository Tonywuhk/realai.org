In July 2017, Elon Musk [called on the government to proactively regulate AI](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/15/15976744/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-regulations-ai) when he spoke at the National Governors Association Summer Meeting in Rhode Island. In a Facebook Live session shortly afterwards,  Mark Zuckerberg called Elon Musk's doomsday AI predictions "[pretty irresponsible](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/24/mark-zuckerberg-elon-musks-doomsday-ai-predictions-are-irresponsible.html)." Elon Musk responded that Mark Zuckerberg's "[understanding of the subject is limited](http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/25/technology/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-ai-artificial-intelligence/index.html)", and added that a movie on the subject of AI was "[coming soon](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/889751762944512002)."

## Global Initiatives

* In a [New York Times opinion](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligence-is-stuck-heres-how-to-move-it-forward.html) published on July 29, 2017, [Gary Marcus](http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gary/) claimed the progress of AI was “stuck” and called for an international AI mission to move it forward. As an example of such a mission, he looked at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) “with envy”.

* [The AI Initiative](http://ai-initiative.org/) is an initiative of [The Future Society](http://www.thefuturesociety.org/) at Harvard Kennedy School dedicated to the rise of Artificial Intelligence. Created in 2015, it gathers students, researchers, alumni, faculty and experts from Harvard and beyond, interested in understanding the consequences of the rise of Artificial Intelligence. Its mission is to help shape the global AI policy framework.

## Universal Basic Income

In May 2017, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for universal basic income ([CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/25/mark-zuckerberg-calls-for-universal-basic-income-at-harvard-speech.html)) to give everyone a cushion to try new ideas, during his [Harvard Commencement speech](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/mark-zuckerbergs-speech-as-written-for-harvards-class-of-2017/). The call was [echoed a few days later](https://www.geek.com/tech-science-3/elon-musk-automation-will-force-universal-basic-income-1701217/) by Elon Musk at the World Government Summit in Dubai. Yuval Noah Harari wrote in an [opinion piece on Bloomberg View](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-04/universal-basic-income-is-neither-universal-nor-basic) that universal basic income (UBI) was neither universal nor basic. UBI initiatives were national or municipal, and it was unclear how to define "basic".

In an empirical study, [Marinescu (2017)](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/no-strings-attached/) found that unconditional cash transfers significantly raised recipients' quality of life, and caused at most a moderate descrease in labor participation.
