In July 2017, Elon Musk [called on the government to proactively regulate AI](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/15/15976744/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-regulations-ai) when he spoke at the National Governors Association Summer Meeting in Rhode Island. In a Facebook Live session shortly afterwards,  Mark Zuckerberg called Elon Musk's doomsday AI predictions "[pretty irresponsible](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/24/mark-zuckerberg-elon-musks-doomsday-ai-predictions-are-irresponsible.html)." Elon Musk responded that Mark Zuckerberg's "[understanding of the subject is limited](http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/25/technology/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-ai-artificial-intelligence/index.html)", and added that a movie on the subject of AI was "[coming soon](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/889751762944512002)."

## Global Collaboration

In a [New York Times opinion](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligence-is-stuck-heres-how-to-move-it-forward.html) published on July 29, 2017, [Gary Marcus](http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gary/) claimed the progress of AI was “stuck” and called for an international AI mission to move it forward. As an example of such a mission, he looked at [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) “with envy”.

## Universal Basic Income

In May 2017, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for universal basic income ([CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/25/mark-zuckerberg-calls-for-universal-basic-income-at-harvard-speech.html)) to give everyone a cushion to try new ideas, during his [Harvard Commencement speech](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/05/mark-zuckerbergs-speech-as-written-for-harvards-class-of-2017/). The call was [echoed a few days later](https://www.geek.com/tech-science-3/elon-musk-automation-will-force-universal-basic-income-1701217/) by Elon Musk at the World Government Summit in Dubai. Yuval Noah Harari wrote in an [opinion piece on Bloomberg View](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-04/universal-basic-income-is-neither-universal-nor-basic) that universal basic income (UBI) was neither universal nor basic. UBI initiatives were national or municipal, and it was unclear how to define "basic".

In an empirical study, [Marinescu (2017)](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/no-strings-attached/) found that unconditional cash transfers significantly raised recipients' quality of life, and caused at most a moderate descrease in labor participation.
