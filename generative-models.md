# Generative Models

## Variational Autoencoders

A subset of latent variables in a VAE can be made interpretable by applying semi-supervised learning, where labels are supplied for these variables ([Siddharth et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00400)).

## Generative Adversarial Networks

[Hu et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00550) establish formal connections between GANs and VAEs, and note that GANs are also related to reinforcement learning, teacher-student distillation and wake-sleep algorithm.
