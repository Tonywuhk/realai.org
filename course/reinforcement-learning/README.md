## Implementations

### OpenAI Baselines

[OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) is an open-source collection of [OpenAI](http://realai.org/research-groups/openai/)'s reinforcement learning implementations. According to their [blog](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-dqn/), it is OpenAI's internal effort to reproduce published results. As of 25 May 2017, these implementations include [DQN](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html), [Double Q Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461), [Prioritized Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952) and [Dueling DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581), using Python 3 and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

We look forward to [A3C](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783) being added to this collection soon.
