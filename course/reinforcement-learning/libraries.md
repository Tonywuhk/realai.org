# Reinforcement Learning Libraries

* 2017 September 9, [TensorFlow Agents](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents) extends the OpenAI Gym interface to multiple parallel environments and allows agents to be implemented in TensorFlow and perform batched computation.
* 2017 July 11, [TensorForce](https://reinforce.io/) is a TensorFlow library for applied reinforcement learning. ([blog](https://reinforce.io/blog/introduction-to-tensorforce/))
* 2016 December 3, [DeepMind Lab](https://github.com/deepmind/lab) is a 3D learning environment based on the [Quake III Arena](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena).
* 2016 April 27, [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. [blog](https://blog.openai.com/openai-gym-beta/).

## rllab

[rllab](https://github.com/rll/rllab) ([Duan et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06778)) is a framework for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, fully compatible with OpenAI Gym. As of [June 2017](https://github.com/rll/rllab/issues/157#issuecomment-307609166), there was no plan to actively develop rllab further, and OpenAI Baselines was expected to be better maintained and more production quality.
