# System

The goal of this section is to set up productive environments for deep learning research.

## Basic IT 

* Cloud Computing:
  * Google products: [Google Cloud Platform](http://realai.org/course/google-cloud-platform/) \| [G Suite](http://realai.org/course/g-suite/)
* Operating System: [Ubuntu](http://realai.org/course/ubuntu/) and [Windows](http://realai.org/course/windows/) are popular operating systems that we will use during this course
* Information [security](http://realai.org/course/security/) contains effective practices to prevent data loss
* Terminal: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) ([cheat sheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/)) is a terminal multiplexer that is available in nearly all UNIX-like operating systems
* [Text processing](http://realai.org/course/text-processing/) with grep, sed, awk, and regular expressions
* Text editor: [Vim](http://realai.org/course/vim/) 
* Version control system: [Git](http://realai.org/course/git/), [GitHub](github.md)
* Python Packages: [conda](http://realai.org/course/conda/), [pip](http://realai.org/course/pip/)

### Amazon Web Services

* 2017 September 20. [Pre-configured Amazon AWS deep learning AMI with Python](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/20/pre-configured-amazon-aws-deep-learning-ami-with-python/). *PyImageSearch*.

## Installing Libraries from Source

* [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) ([documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/)), a fast and scalable build system that only builds what is necessary
* [Wheel](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel) ([documentation](http://wheel.rtfd.org/)) is a built-package format for Python with a specially formatted filename and the .whl extension.
* [Lab](http://realai.org/course/lab/): [Installing Sonnet from Source](http://realai.org/course/lab/sonnet-source/)

## Hardware

For those who are interested in building a tangible computer:

* 2017 May 28. [The $1700 great Deep Learning box: Assembly, setup and benchmarks](https://blog.slavv.com/the-1700-great-deep-learning-box-assembly-setup-and-benchmarks-148c5ebe6415). Slav Ivanov.
