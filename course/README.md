# Course

The goal of this course is to provide an adequate *technical* foundation for students to push the [research frontiers in deep reinforcement learning](http://realai.org/deep-reinforcement-learning/), an academic area that is a main driving force behind rapid [progress](http://realai.org/progress/) in AI since 2013, and represents an important step towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). The journey to AGI is likely long and difficult, for which a [timely](http://realai.org/timing/) arrival requires patient and through preparations. The [Background](http://realai.org/background/) section of this site covers general-level topics in related fields such as [neuroscience](http://realai.org/background/neuroscience/), [cognitive science](http://realai.org/background/cognitive-science/), [physics (computation)](http://realai.org/background/computation/) and [philosophy](../background/philosophy/README.md). These are critical pillars of knowledge that support an accurate intuition of what intelligence is. Without their guidance, students get still obtain highly publishable results in mainstream AI research. These results, however, will highly unlikely be cited within the knowledge structure that reach AGI.

More importantly, even under the guidance of modern scientific knowledge, an AGI system is unlikely to be safe and beneficial if it is not developed with sufficient considerations in [AI safety](http://realai.org/safety/). Therefore, the proper sequence for serious AGI developers should be safety first, followed by a sound understanding of what intelligence is, and finally a solid technical foundation for implementation.
