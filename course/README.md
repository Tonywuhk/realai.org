# Course

## System 

The goal of the [System](http://realai.org/course/system/) section is to set up productive environments for deep learning research.

## Programming in Python

* Programming language: [Python](http://realai.org/course/python/)
* Interactive Code Editor: [Jupyter Notebook](http://realai.org/course/jupyter/)

## Deep Learning in TensorFlow

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is one of the most popular [deep learning libraries](http://realai.org/course/lib/) that we will use to implement projects. We can set it up in a [Jupyter Notebook running on GCE](http://realai.org/course/GCE/jupyter/).
