# Course

## Basic IT

[Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) (GCE) is a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) service that delivers scalable, high-performance virtual machines (VMs). It charges for usage based on a [pricing sheet](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing) but also offers a [free-trial](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/frequently-asked-questions) for new customers. After sign-up, users will be able to manage [VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) of different machine types. These machine types typically have 1 to 64 virtual CPUs, 3.75 to 240GB memory and are charged at different rates. Each instance requires a disk to boot from. For example, a 10GB boot disk image can be chosen for a VM to run Ubuntu 16.04 [LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS). Virtual machines can be used for many purposes other than AI research. For those interested, a trading algorithm can be hosted in just [6 easy steps](https://robotwealth.com/run-trading-algorithms-google-cloud-platform-6-easy-steps/), as of July 2017.

[Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) is a popular operating system that we will use during this course.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a popular code repository hosting site that uses the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system. [Git How To](https://githowto.com/) offers a simple guided tour that walks through the fundamentals of Git.

[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is a text editor built for editing efficiency, but is also known for having a steep learning curve. In most UNIX systems, type `vi` to launch the editor, or type `vimtutor` for a brief overview.

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively. On a newly created Ubuntu 16.04 LTS VM on GCE, we can type `python3` to launch it. The [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an open source project that was born out of the [IPython Project](https://ipython.org/), and is a good tool for interactive data science and scientific computing.

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is one of the most popular [deep learning libraries](http://realai.org/course/lib/) that we will use to implement projects. We can set it up in a [Jupyter Notebook running on GCE](http://realai.org/course/gce/jupyter/).
