# Deep Learning

Deep learning is machine learning with large-scale "deep" computing architectures, such as [convolutional neural networks](http://realai.org/course/deep-learning/convolutional-neural-network/) (CNNs) and [recurrent neural networks](http://realai.org/course/deep-learning/recurrent-neural-network/) (RNNs). During learning, the parameters of these models are typically updated according to one or more rules of [gradient descent](http://realai.org/course/deep-learning/gradient-descent/). Deep learning is a key enabler of the rapid [progress](http://realai.org/progress/) in AI since 2013, and is surprisingly easy when learned properly. [Howard (2017)](http://www.fast.ai/2017/09/08/introducing-pytorch-for-fastai/) stated that only "high school math, one year of coding experience, and seven weeks of study" were required to "become a world-class deep learning practitioner," and even that would be too slow as students started to use more productive [deep learning libraries](http://realai.org/course/deep-learning/libraries/) such as [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/).

## Further Reading

* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) is dedicated to making the power of deep learning accessible to all. As of August 2017, it offers two 7-week courses: [Practical Deep Learning For Coders, Part 1](http://course.fast.ai/) and [Cutting Edge Deep Learning For Coders, Part 2](http://course.fast.ai/part2.html). Part 1 covers basic CNN and RNN. Part 2 covers more advanced projects such as style transfer, GAN, attention, and memory.
* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) is a series of 5 fee-based [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) courses created by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). As of August 2017, the series' topics are "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization", "Structuring Machine Learning Projects", "Convolutional Neural Networks" and "Sequence Models."
