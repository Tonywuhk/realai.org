# Continual Learning

Continual learning focuses on an agent's ability to learn new tasks without forgetting old ones. Skills learned from old tasks may or may not [transfer](http://realai.org/transfer-learning/) to new tasks, but must be largely retained. One approach is to penalize learning for weights that are important for remembering old tasks. [Zenke & Poole & Ganguli (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04200) introduce *intelligent synapses* that compute importance measures of weights online. They evaluate this approach on the split and permuted MNIST, and split versions of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. There is an [open-source implementation](https://github.com/spiglerg/TF_ContinualLearningViaSynapticIntelligence) of their model applied to the permuted MNIST benchmark. The elastic weight consolidation (EWC) ([Kirkpatrick et al, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00796)) method relies on computing the Fisher information metric at the end of each task. [Seff et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08395) explain that both of these methods can be adapted to training conditional GANs.

Another approach to prevent catastrophic forgetting is to design novel network architectures. PathNets ([Fernando et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08734)) are large neural networks where the learning of a particular task evolves towards a subset of parameters, these parameters are then fixed before learning moves on to the next task. Note that when such a large architecture is viewed as a family of possible standard deep neural networks, [Veniat & Denoyer (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00046) demonstrate that reinforcement learning can be used to discover networks that are efficient in computational cost (Flop) or time (milliseconds).

A more intuitive method is to add new components for adaption to new tasks. The progressive network ([Rusu & Rabinowitz et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04671)) instantiates a new column for each new task being solved. [Rosenfeld & Tsotsos (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04228) adds a controller to each convolutional layer in a trained neural network that mixes the filters in that layer to adapt to a new task. A new set of controllers is required for each new task. [Lee et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01547) propose the Dynamically Expandable Network (DEN) model that learns a sequence of tasks in an online manner. When a new taska arrives, it first retrains only the weights affected by the new task. Additionally, it expands the network if the above selective retraining does not reach a performance threshold. Finally, it splits the network by duplicating neurons that drift too far in the previous one or two training stages, and trains the weights again as the overall network structure has changed due to the split. They validate DEN on multiple classification datasets including MNIST-Variation, CIFAR-10, and AWA-Class.

While current research largely focuses on not forgetting old tasks, eventually we'd like an AI system to be capable of learning a long series of diverse tasks, i.e. lifelong learning. By that time, there may not be a clear distinction between training and testing. It's plausible that through sustained learning, such a system can accumulate a vast amount of knowledge that forms the basis of "common sense", or a "world model." Besides that, we also hope to review studies that focus on augmenting the input and output modules of a deep architecture to adapt to new tasks without forgetting the old ones.

## Evolutionary Algorithms 

[Ellefsen et al. (2015)](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004128) evolve neural networks with a cost for neural connections. This causes modularity and reduces the problem of catastrophic forgetting. Introducing modulatory signals based on nodes' location in the neural network, [Velez & Clune (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07241) show that diffusion-based neuromodulation induces task-specific learning in groups of nodes and connections, which produces functional modules for each task.
