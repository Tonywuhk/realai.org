# Roadmaps

## Outstanding Challenges

During the [Beneficial AI 2017](https://futureoflife.org/bai-2017/) conference, Demis Hassabis from [DeepMind](http://realai.org/research-groups/deepmind/) gave a talk on the morning of January 7 titled "Exploration into Optimality". At the [beginning of the talk](https://youtu.be/otJKzpNWZT4?t=28s), the problem of solving intelligence was cast in the framework of reinforcement learning. Near the [end of the talk](https://youtu.be/otJKzpNWZT4?t=20m32s), the following area were listed as key problems to be solved to get close to AGI:

* Imagination-based Planning with Generative Models
* Hierarchical Planning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Memory and one-short learning
* Abstract Concepts
* Continual and Transfer Learning

In the [panel discussion](https://youtu.be/V0aXMTpZTfc?t=23m57s) that followed, Hassabis elaborated more on these problems and added *language grounding* as another "mountain" on the path to AGI. He was sure there would be more than 6 mountains left, but would be surprised if there were "more than about 20".

In a talk titled [How does the brain learn so much so quickly?](https://youtu.be/cWzi38-vDbE?t=34m55s) given at [CCN 2017](http://ccneuro.org/), Yann LeCun from [FAIR](research-groups/facebook-AI-research.md) gave a "very personal opinion" that the main technical issue we're facing in AI today is to train the world simulator, or using the phrase in his own slides:

* Learning Predictive Forward Models of the World
