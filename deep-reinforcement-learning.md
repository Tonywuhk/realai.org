# Deep Reinforcement Learning

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a subfield that uses deep learning algorithms within RL. It is a main driving force behind rapid [progress](http://realai.org/progress/) in AI since 2013, and represents an important step towards developing AGI. [Henderson & Islam et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06560) note that reported state-of-the-art DRL results are difficult to interpret, due to factors such as environment non-determinism and variance intrinsic to DRL methods.
