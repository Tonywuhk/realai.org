## Other Bets

### Waymo

According to a [report from The Atlantic on August 23, 2017](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/inside-waymos-secret-testing-and-simulation-facilities/537648/), Waymo conduct “structured testing” program at a secret base in the Central Valley they call Castle. There are also 25,000 virtual self-driving cars making their way through fully modeled versions of Austin, Mountain View, and Phoenix in a simulation called Carcraft. Silicon Valley Business Journal [reported in October 2017](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/10/03/waymo-to-launch-ride-sharing-service-if-it-can-get.html) that according to The Information, Waymo wants to launch the first commercial ride-sharing service with no human safety drivers as soon as this fall. Later that month, Waymo [released its first self-driving 'Safety Report'](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/waymo-self-driving-safety-report/).

#### Analyst's Opinions

Following its [recent deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/technology/lyft-waymo-self-driving-cars.html) with Lyft to collaborate on self-driving cars, Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak [wrote to clients around 23 May 2017](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/23/alphabets-self-driving-waymo-unit-could-be-worth-70-billion-more-than-gm-morgan-stanley-says.html) that as a potential spin-out candidate, Waymo could be worth $70 billion.

In June 2017, Waymo [reached an agreement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/alphabet-inks-deal-for-avis-to-manage-self-driving-car-fleet) for Avis to manage its fleet of autonomous vehicles.
