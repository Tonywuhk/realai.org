# Google

According to [information on Wikipedia accessed in September 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#Alphabet), Google LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of XXVI Holdings Inc., which is a subsidiary of [Alphabet Inc.](http://realai.org/industry/alphabet/) to hold the equity of its other subsidiaries.

## AI and Machine Learning 

Google’s AI efforts are brought together under [Google.ai](https://google.ai/), a site focused on bringing the benefits of AI to everyone. Google’s [TensorFlow Research Cloud](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc/) is a cluster of 1,000 [Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/) that support machine learning research for free. The Cloud TPUs are purpose-built for machine learning workloads, including both training and prediction, and each Cloud TPU delivers up to 180 teraflops of performance. In contrast, [NVIDIA](http://realai.org/industry/nvidia/) claims its [Volta](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/volta-gpu-architecture/) GPU delivers over 100 teraflops. According to a Google [blog post](https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/google-cloud-offer-tpus-machine-learning/), a machine learning supercomputer called “TPU pod” can be built with 64 TPUs to provide up to 11.5 petaflops of computation.

In July 2017, Google [launched](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/ai-studio/) its own AI studio, [Google Developers Launchpad](https://developers.google.com/startups/studio/), a full-service studio that provides tailored technical and product support to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning startups, all in one place.

On 26 May 2017, Axios [reported](https://www.axios.com/exclusive-google-launches-ai-investment-arm-2423046588.html) that Google launched a new venture capital program focused on AI. Google officially [announced](https://www.blog.google/topics/machine-learning/introducing-gradient-ventures/) Gradient Ventures in July. CNBC [reported](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/10/google-launches-gradient-ventures-to-invest-in-a-i-start-ups.html) that it would invest in 10 to 15 deals in 2017 and would typically commit $1 million to $8 million in each.

In a [research report](https://ark-invest.com/research/googles-ai) dated May 23, 2017, ARK Investment called Google a full stack AI company.

### Talent

According to a June 2016 [post](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/how-google-is-remaking-itself-as-a-machine-learning-first-company/) on Wired, internally Google has a Machine Learning Ninja Program, a four-week boot camp that pulls its talented coders from their teams to participate.

Google Brain Toronto was launched in March 2017. According to a Google Official Canada Blog [post authored by Geoffrey Hinton](https://canada.googleblog.com/2017/03/canadas-ai-moment.html) and published on the day of launch, Google is committed to supporting Canada's amazing AI moment.

In October 2017, Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-19/google-wants-to-train-other-companies-to-use-its-ai-tools) that Google is starting what it calls an "AI crash course" of free online tutorials, scripted by its staff and designed for software coders new to machine learning.

## Hardware

In September 2017, Google [paid $1.1 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-htc-m-a-google/google-bets-anew-on-smartphones-pays-1-1-billion-for-htcs-pixel-division-idUSKCN1BW06L) for [HTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC)'s Pixel division. Google announced Pixel 2 ([TechCrunch report](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/04/this-is-the-google-pixel-2-arriving-october-17-for-649/) on October 4, 2017, arriving October 17 for $649.

## Retail

[Google Express](https://express.google.com/) is an online shopping service in continental U.S. that lets its users shop from an array of stores all in one place. In August 2017, Google [entered a partnership with Walmart](https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/shop-walmart-and-more-your-favorite-stores-faster/) to sell its products on Google Home or Google Express.

## Europe

### Legal Problems

In June 2017, The European Commission [fined Google €2.42 billion](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1784_en.htm) for antitrust violations pertaining to its shopping comparison service. By September 2017, Google said it would treat its own shopping service the same as rivals when they bid for ads at the top of a search page, according to a [Reuters report](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-google-antitrust/google-to-treat-shopping-rivals-equally-in-line-with-eu-order-idUSKCN1C22AE). Regulators are also weighing [another record fine over its Android mobile operating system](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-google-antitrust-exclusive-idUSKBN19Q1RU), and there is a third case involving its AdSense for Search platform. Google [tapped at least five top law firms](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/10/googles-eu-fine-top-law-firms-hired-to-fight-fine-sources.html) in Brussels to fight the regulatory battles.

Google could also face [€1.12 billion in back taxes to France](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-11/google-faces-1-3-billion-french-ruling-amid-rising-tax-populism).
