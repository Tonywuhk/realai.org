### Artificial Intelligence

Google’s AI efforts are brought together under [Google.ai](https://google.ai/), a site focused on bringing the benefits of AI to everyone. Google’s [TensorFlow Research Cloud](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc/) is a cluster of 1,000 [Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/) that support machine learning research for free. The Cloud TPUs are purpose-built for machine learning workloads, including both training and prediction, and each Cloud TPU deilvers up to 180 teraflops of performance. In contrast, [NVIDIA](http://realai.org/companies/nvidia/) claims its [Volta](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/volta-gpu-architecture/) GPU delivers over 100 teraflops. According to a Google [blog post](https://www.blog.google/topics/google-cloud/google-cloud-offer-tpus-machine-learning/), a machine learning supercomputer called “TPU pod” can be built with 64 TPUs to provide up to 11.5 petaflops of computation.

On 26 May 2017, Axios [reported](https://www.axios.com/exclusive-google-launches-ai-investment-arm-2423046588.html) that Google launched a new venture capital program focused on AI. Google officially [announced](https://www.blog.google/topics/machine-learning/introducing-gradient-ventures/) Gradient Ventures in July. CNBC [reported](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/10/google-launches-gradient-ventures-to-invest-in-a-i-start-ups.html) that it would invest in 10 to 15 deals in 2017 and would typically commit $1 million to $8 million in each.

In a [research report](https://ark-invest.com/research/googles-ai) dated May 23, 2017, ARK Investment called Google a full stack AI company.

### Legal Problems in Europe

In June 2017, The European Commission [fined Google €2.42 billion](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1784_en.htm) for antitrust violations pertaining to its shopping comparison service. Regulators are also weighing [another record fine over its Android mobile operating system](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-google-antitrust-exclusive-idUSKBN19Q1RU), and there is a third case involving its AdSense for Search platform. Google [tapped at least five top law firms](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/10/googles-eu-fine-top-law-firms-hired-to-fight-fine-sources.html) in Brussels to fight the regulatory battles.

Google could also face [€1.12 billion in back taxes to France](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-11/google-faces-1-3-billion-french-ruling-amid-rising-tax-populism).

## Waymo

### Analyst's Opinions

Following its [recent deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/technology/lyft-waymo-self-driving-cars.html) with Lyft to collaborate on self-driving cars, Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak [wrote to clients around 23 May 2017](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/23/alphabets-self-driving-waymo-unit-could-be-worth-70-billion-more-than-gm-morgan-stanley-says.html) that as a potential spin-out candidate, Waymo could be worth $70 billion.

In June 2017, Waymo [reached an agreement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/alphabet-inks-deal-for-avis-to-manage-self-driving-car-fleet) for Avis to manage its fleet of autonomous vehicles.
