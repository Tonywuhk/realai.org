# Forecasts

## Milestones

Below is a list of milestones that we forecast will be achieved based on our *subjective* views of progress in deep learning. These forecasts are highly likely to change as new discoveries are made and new results announced.

* 2018 March 17 (± 3 months). [Groundbreaking Results from DeepMind](#groundbreaking-results-from-deepmind).
* 2019 March 6 (± 3 months). [Multi-Player No-Limit Poker](#multi-player-no-limit-poker).
* 2021 July 19 (± 12 months). [Proving Mathematical Theorems](http://realai.org/forecasts/proving-mathematical-theorems/).

### Groundbreaking Results from DeepMind

Financial Times [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/cada14c4-d366-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0) on March 17, 2017 that [DeepMind](http://realai.org/research-groups/deepmind/
) hoped to publish six more papers in highly regarded scientific journals [Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)) or [Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)) “within the next year”. DeepMind is an [Alphabet](http://realai.org/industry/alphabet/) subsidiary that has published [over two hundred papers](http://realai.org/research-groups/publications/deepmind/), including [three](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/abs/nature14236.html) [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html) [papers](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7626/abs/nature20101.html) since February 2015. Given its track record, and the existence of [six](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427) [high-quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06551) [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02286) [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03389) [on](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06170) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887), we are convinced of this estimate and assign a **90% confidence interval of ± 3 months** that six groundbreaking results will come from DeepMind by **March 17, 2018**.

A September 2017 [blog post](https://machinethoughts.wordpress.com/2017/09/01/deep-meaning-beyond-thought-vectors/) suggests that "there is currently a significant effort at DeepMind based on deep inductive logic programming (Deep ILP) for bottom-up programs and that a paper will appear in the next few months."

### Multi-Player No-Limit Poker

Multi-player no-limit [Texas hold’em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) is one of the most popular forms of poker, widely televised in events like the [World Series of Poker](http://www.wsop.com/). On March 6, 2017, University of Alberta professor [Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/) [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelHBowling/status/838426697817067520) that in this game, computer programs would beat human pros in “a couple years”. Prof. Bowling is a world-leading expert in computer poker. He led a [research group](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/) that published [Cepheus](http://poker.srv.ualberta.ca/) in [January 2015](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6218/145.full), the first AI to solve *heads-up limit* Texas hold’em, and [DeepStack](https://www.deepstack.ai/) in [March 2017](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/03/01/science.aam6960), the first AI capable of beating pros at *heads-up no-limit* Texas Hold’em. Given Prof. Bowling’s track record, we are convinced of his estimate and assign a **90% confidence interval of ± 3 months** that computers will beat pros in *multi-player no-limit* poker on **March 6, 2019**.

In July 2017, Prof. Bowling joined DeepMind to colead its [newly created research office in Edmonton, Alberta](https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-office-canada-edmonton/). DeepMind is the Alphabet subsidiary that developed [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/), the first computer program to achieve superhuman performance in the ancient Chinese game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)).
