# OpenAI

OpenAI is a non-profit AI research company founded on [December 11, 2015](https://blog.openai.com/introducing-openai/) for which prominent tech executives have [pledged $1bn](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35082344).

It is stated in OpenAI's [mission](https://openai.com/about/#mission) that "We will not keep information private for private benefit, but in the long term, we expect to create formal processes for keeping technologies private when there are safety concerns". In its [$30 million grant](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/openai-general-support) to support OpenAI, the Open Philanthropy Project noted and [archived](http://files.openphilanthropy.org/files/Grants/OpenAI/OpenAI_Mission.pdf) this mission.

OpenAI's [technical goals](https://blog.openai.com/openai-technical-goals/) include building a measure of research progress, and agents that can perform housework, understand natural language, and solve a wide variety of games.

## Safety

In April 2017, the safety implications of OpenAI was discussed online under the heading "OpenAI makes humanity less safe" at blog sites [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/oul/openai_makes_humanity_less_safe/) and [Compass Rose](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/openai-makes-humanity-less-safe/).

In an [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/protecting-against-ais-existential-threat-1508332313) published on Wall Street Journal in October 2017, Ilya Sutskever and Dario Amodei gave an example of future AI doing harm where an AI tasked with maximizing profits for a corporation could deliberately cause political upheaval. Both authors at the time were affiliated with OpenAI and the article was [tweeted](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/920684033582841856) by OpenAI's official Twitter account.

## Sponsors

A group of sponsors committed $1 billion at OpenAI's formation, although only a tiny fraction was expected to be spent in the next a few years.

## Team

The OpenAI team had 45 people as of [January 30, 2017](https://blog.openai.com/team-update-january/). At the end of February 2017, Ian Goodfellow, who [joined no later than March 2016](https://blog.openai.com/team-plus-plus/) as a full-timer, [left and returned to Google Brain](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5y6uy8/d_did_ian_goodfellow_leave_openai/). In June 2017, Andrej Karpathy, who had been a [founding member](https://blog.openai.com/introducing-openai/) since December 2015, [moved to Tesla](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/tesla-hires-deep-learning-expert-andrej-karpathy-to-lead-autopilot-vision/) for a key Autopilot role. During the same month, it was [suggested on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14636596) that engineers who worked on OpenAI Universe have been laid off.

## Formation

In July 2015, over a dinner in Menlo Park, Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever and a few others discussed the idea of OpenAI. Between August and November, Greg was introduced to Andrej Karpathy, Wojciech Zaremba, Durk Kingma, and John Schulman. He also found engineers Trevor Blackwell and Vicki Cheung. OpenAI was announced on December 11, its founding team consisted of everyone mentioned here and Pamela Vagata. The team began work on January 4, 2016.
