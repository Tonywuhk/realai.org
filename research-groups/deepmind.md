# DeepMind

## Overview

[DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) Technologies Limited is a private limited company incorporated on September 23, 2010. Until November 15, 2010, its name was "FRIARS 2022 LIMITED". Google acquired DeepMind for more than $500M, as [reported by TechCrunch on January 26, 2014](https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/26/google-deepmind/), or £400m as [understood by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind). In a [Wired UK report on June 22, 2015](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind), DeepMind's cofounder and chief executive Demis Hassabis reflected on why he sold the company, "I realised that there's maybe not enough time in one lifetime to both build a Google-sized company and solve AI. Would I be happier looking back on building a multi-billion business or helping solve intelligence? It was an easy choice. And there was something Larry said to me: 'I spent 15 years building Google -- why don't you just come and take advantage of the opportunity we've built here?' I didn't have a good answer to that."

On 23 October 2014, Google [announced on its Europe blog](https://europe.googleblog.com/2014/10/teaming-up-with-oxford-university-on.html) that Oxford's AI research teams Dark Blue Labs and Vision Factory would join DeepMind. This news was reported by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/23/googles-deepmind-acqui-hires-two-ai-teams-in-the-uk-partners-with-oxford/) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/23/google-uk-artificial-intelligence-startups-machine-learning-dark-blue-labs-vision-factory).

DeepMind has two main lines of business: Research and Applied. Its organized efforts in research has yielded a long list of [publications](http://realai.org/research-groups/publications/deepmind/).

## Locations

According to [Rowan (2015)](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind), DeepMind stayed in London partly because of a talent advantage. On Silicon Valley, Hassabis noted that "if you're focusing on a long-term goal, the Valley can be a bubble."

### Edmonton Office

In July 2017, DeepMind [opened](https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-office-canada-edmonton/) its "first ever international AI research office" in Edmonton, Canada, which would be led by [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) professors [Rich Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/index.html), [Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/) and Patrick Pilarski. The opening was reported by [Edmonton Journal](http://edmontonjournal.com/business/local-business/paula-simons-global-head-snap-googles-deepmind-sets-up-shop-in-edmonton) and [Bloomberg Technology](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-05/deepmind-goes-to-alberta-for-first-international-lab).

### Montreal Office

In October 2017, DeepMind [opened](https://deepmind.com/blog/strengthening-our-commitment-canadian-research/) an office in Montreal, in close collaboration with McGill University. It will be led by [Doina Precup](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/), Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill. Doina will be supported by Shibl Mourad who will head up the engineering and program management teams at DeepMind Montreal and DeepMind Alberta.

### Mountain View

It was [reported](http://uk.businessinsider.com/deepminds-small-army-of-ai-researchers-in-mountain-view-is-growing-2017-5) in May 2017 that DeepMind had almost two dozen staff working out of an office in Mountain View, California. Since the Edmonton office was officially called the "first ever international AI research office," and Mountain View is international with respect to the UK, this location must not be an "AI research office."

## Ethics

When Google acquired DeepMind, it [agreed to establish an ethics board](https://www.theinformation.com/google-beat-facebook-for-deepmind-creates-ethics-board). The Guardian [reported in January 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/26/google-deepmind-ai-ethics-board) that the board was internal and discussed confidential matters. When asked about the board in January 2016, DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis replied that it had convened and was "progressing very well." It can also be inferred from [an official job ad](https://deepmind.com/careers/655890/) that DeepMind has an "Ethics & Impact team".

### DeepMind Ethics & Society

[DeepMind Ethics & Society](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-ethics-society/) (DMES) is a research unit that aims to explore and better understand the real-world impacts of AI. It aims to help technologists put ethics into practice and help society anticipate and control the effects of AI. DMES [research](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-ethics-society/research/) themes include privacy, transparency and fairness; economic impacts; governance and accountability; managing AI risk; AI morality and values; and how AI can address the worlds challenges. DMES intends to undertake research and collaborations in each of these areas, with priorities determined by the differing degrees of urgency of the challenges ahead.

DeepMind also acknowledges that "technology is not value neutral, and technologists must take responsibility for the ethical and social impact of their work." DMES is created because they believe "AI can be of extraordinary benefit to the world, but only if held to the highest ethical standards."

#### Creation

On October 3, 2017, DeepMind announced in a [blog post](https://deepmind.com/blog/why-we-launched-deepmind-ethics-society/) the creation of DMES, a new research unit that aims to help technologists put ethics into practice, and to help society anticipate and direct the impact of AI so that it works for the benefit of all. The unit is co-led by Verity Harding ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/verity-harding-b8390b9b/); [Twitter](https://twitter.com/verityharding)) and Sean Legassick ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanlegassick/); [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seanlegassick)).

According to a [Wired UK](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-ethics-and-society-artificial-intelligence) report about the creation of DMES, the unit has been in development for the past 18 months. Its full-time team will swell from around 8 currently to around 25 people within the next 12 months. DMES initially has six external fellows, including Oxford professor Nick Bostrom, and they have not signed any non-disclosure agreements. DMES is separate to the firms secretive internal ethics and safety board, which has been reasonably successful, but aims at challenges that arise specifically from general intelligence, says DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. It is further noted in a [report by The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/04/google-deepmind-ai-artificial-intelligence-ethics-group-problems) that it remains a mystery who is on it, what they discuss, or even whether it has officially met. Nonetheless, the creation of DMES is  the hallmark of a change in attitude from DeepMind over the past year, which has seen the company reassess its previously closed and secretive outlook.

## Competitive Advantages

In a July 2017 [interview](https://www.leiphone.com/news/201707/3tgq679xJMqKGhxM.html), UCL professor [Jun Wang](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/blog/) explained why there wasn't a company like DeepMind in China. Wang noted that venture capital investors were unlikely to fund long-term fundamental research, and universities lacked mechanism for a large number of PhD students to collaborate.

### Research Strategy

In a [July 2017 interview with The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/19/15998610/ai-neuroscience-machine-learning-deepmind-demis-hassabis-interview), Hassabis stated that "one of our big founding principles was that embodied cognition is key." This means to induce intelligence from "sensory and motor streams."

According to a [Financial Times report on March 17, 2017](https://www.ft.com/content/cada14c4-d366-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0), DeepMind’s researchers are organised into four main groups including “Neuroscience” and “Frontiers”, each consisting of smaller teams with deeper specialties. "Strike teams" can be formed temporarily to achieve a particular goal. Resources are allocated to projects by team leaders including Hassabis and head of research Shane Legg, who said "It’s sort of a bubbling cauldron of ideas, and exploration, and testing things out, and finding out what seems to be working and why — or why not."

#### Progress

In June 2017, DeepMind [described in a blog](https://deepmind.com/blog/neural-approach-relational-reasoning/) a simple neural net module called Relation Network (RN) that can reason about pairwise relations of objects. It was "One of the most important deep learning papers of the year, thus far", according to a [tweet from @NandoDF](https://twitter.com/NandoDF/status/871979114726641664).

## Applications

DeepMind Applied is led by Mustafa Suleyman, and works in two sectors: [DeepMind Health](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/) and [DeepMind for Google](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-for-google/).

In March 2017, a machine learning expert [believed](http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/google-will-disrupt-funds-management-says-machine-learning-expert-20170329-gv93jc) that a new powerful **fund management** machine would likely emerge from DeepMind.

## Financials

Quartz [reported](https://qz.com/1095833/how-much-googles-deepmind-ai-research-costs-goog/) in October 2017 that DeepMind lost £123.5 million on £40.2 million of revenue in the previous year. DeepMind's [official records](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07386350) are available from [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house). According to these records:

| (£)            | 2016          | 2015          | 2014          |
| -------------- | -------------:| -------------:| -------------:|
| Turnover       |    40,283,597 | -             | -             |
| Operating Loss | (123,528,400) | (54,162,443)  | (38,182,149)  |
