# Transfer Learning

[Transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) is a goal of machine learning to more efficiently solve new tasks by leveraging experiences learned from old tasks.

## Notes

Policy distillation ([Rusu et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06295)) is a technique to transfer one or more action policies from Q-networks to an untrained network. It can be used to consolidate multiple task-specific policies into a single policy. A similar way to accomplish this is Actor-Mimic ([Parisotto et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06342)).

Another mechanism for knowledge transfer is to build new networks from existing ones ([Chen et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05641); [Wei et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01670); [Wei et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03281)).

A form of transfer learning is domain adaptation. In some reinforcement learning domain adaptation scenarios, an agent trained on a *source* domain needs to perform well on a *target* domain that is similar to the source in some aspects, such as reward structure and action space. [Higgins & Pal et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08475) propose a multi-stage RL agent, DARLA (DisentAngled Representation Learning Agent), that learns in three stages: see, act, and transfer. Using an unsupervised model, DARLA first learns a disentangled representation ([Higgins et al., 2017](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy2fzU9gl)) of the observations in stage 1. In stage 2, the agent learns a policy to solve source tasks based on the representation learned earlier, fixed throughout learning during this stage. When tested on target tasks in stage 3, DARLA significantly outperforms [baselines](DRL/learning-algorithms.md) DQN, A3C and Episodic Control.
